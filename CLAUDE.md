# UKBoardgames — "Buy in the UK?" Advisor

One-off personal tool. Ranks every board game on Zatu's catalogue worth buying during a UK trip:
good games, hard to get or pricier in France, ideally coop/party, ideally low-language-dependence.
Full spec: `docs/spec.md` — read it before implementing anything, it has the pipeline, scoring
formulas, config schema, and fixture data to code against offline.

## Workflow

- Solo side project. Work directly on `main`, push directly — no PRs, no feature branches.

## Pipeline (see docs/spec.md §2-3 for full detail)

```
Stage 0  Zatu JSON harvest      /collections/top-5000-board-games/products.json (Shopify, public)
Stage 1  Board-game filter      light cleanup, Stage 0 is already game-scoped
Stage 2  BGG bulk match+gate    offline match vs pre-downloaded bg_ranks.csv, no network
Stage 3  BGG enrich             thing?id=... + Bearer token (mechanics, language, FR edition)
Stage 4  Zatu detail            price/stock/EAN, mostly already in Stage 0's JSON
Stage 5  Philibert lookup       EAN search first, title fallback; FR availability + price
Stage 6  Scoring                advantage + quality + genre + language = composite
Stage 7  Static HTML output     sortable table, full result set, source links
```

## Key design rules

- **Zatu is the universe** — a game not sold by Zatu is out of scope.
- **Precision over recall in matching**: ambiguous matches are dropped (`dropped.csv`), never
  surfaced for manual review — thousands of candidates make per-game confirmation impossible.
- **No fixed output cutoff** — every game passing the quality gate with a genuine UK advantage
  appears in the ranked table; the person drills down as far as they want.
- **Cheap wide pass, expensive narrow pass**: filter for free (Zatu JSON + local BGG CSV) before
  making per-page HTTP calls (BGG `thing`, Philibert) on the surviving few hundred.
- Price is the *weakest* signal (max 25 pts) — availability/no-FR-edition matters more.

## Data sources & gotchas

- **BGG**: `thing`/`search` need a registered app + `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (register at
  boardgamegeek.com/applications — approval takes a week+). Bulk ranked CSV
  (`bg_ranks.csv`) needs no token — download by hand once, logged into a browser, use it for
  Stage 2. Max 20 ids/call, can return HTTP 202 (poll w/ backoff), 5s courtesy rate limit.
  Fallback if no token: scrape public game pages (mechanics/language/versions are in plain HTML).
- **Zatu**: Shopify. Public `/products.json` and `/collections/<handle>/products.json`, no auth.
  **Locale/currency bug**: unforced requests can return USD instead of GBP — force UK locale and
  assert currency == GBP before trusting any price, or every discount calc is silently wrong.
  `barcode` field on variants is the EAN when present — stronger match key than fuzzy title.
- **Philibert**: PrestaShop, no bulk export — needs page fetches. EAN is in a labeled `EAN` field
  under "Fiche technique" (authoritative) and often in the URL (`...-<ean13>.html`, fast
  pre-filter). `Langue(s)` field is the primary FR-language signal. Ignore `product.oos` /
  `product.declinaisons` strings seen in cross-sell widgets — unrendered template leakage, not data.

## Tech

Python: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`/`lxml`, `rapidfuzz`, `pandas`, `jinja2`. SQLite cache keyed by
source+id (incremental re-runs, resumable). Adapters behind a common interface:
`sources/{zatu,philibert,bgg}.py`, `match.py`, `score.py`, `render.py`. All tunable weights/thresholds
live in one YAML config (docs/spec.md §10) — re-scoring never needs re-scraping or code changes.

## Build order

1. Register BGG app + download `bg_ranks.csv` (do this first — token approval is slow).
2. Zatu JSON harvest + offline match/quality-gate/score against the CSV → first usable ranked list.
3. BGG enrich (best-effort, decoupled — don't block the pipeline if the token isn't ready yet).
4. Philibert adapter (EAN first, title fallback).
5. Fill any Zatu detail gaps, then HTML render.
